### Overview

Using Machine Learning algorithms to cluster Mutual Funds, using funds characteristics and performance. 
The goal in the clustering is to find if similar funds even if they have different classification.


The work is divided in 3 notebooks:

1. Data_Import.ipynb
     
	 Pulling data excel file, deleting columns, formatting the data and saving clean csv.
2. EDA.ipynb
     
	 Describing data, generating histogram, scatter and correlation heatmap plots.
3. Feature_eng_and_Model.ipynb
   
### Methods
 - Statistic data description using Pandas,Numpy,wordcloud, librarys in Python.
