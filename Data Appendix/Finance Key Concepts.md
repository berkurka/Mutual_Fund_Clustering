## What are mutual funds

You can think of a mutual fund as a company that brings together a large group of people and invests their money on their behalf in a portfolio. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund)

## Definitions used in this project:
- Return: [Increase in price of fund’s shares over a period.](https://www.investopedia.com/university/quality-mutual-fund/chp4-fund-risk-return/mf-returns.asp)
- Volatility: [Dispersion of fund returns in a given period.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp)
- Fund Size: Market value of all financial assets in a mutual fund. (Aka AUM)
- Fund Age: Number of months since the fund started operating.

## Benckmark vs Performance Index

- A benchmark is a standard against which the performance of a security, mutual fund or investment manager can be measured. Generally, broad market and market-segment stock and bond indexes are used for this purpose. [Learn more] (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp)

- The Performance Index is related to the Performance Fee calculation benchmark. If a fund return is above its performance index, the fund will charge a performance fee. The performance fee is designed to reward managers that outperform the fund´s performance index. Most of the time the performance index and fund benckmarks are the same.

## Types of Mutual Fund
- Equity fund: Invests in stocks.
- Balanced fund: Invests in stocks and bonds (Aka hybrid funds).
- Fixed income fund: Invests in bonds.
- Currency fund: Invest in foreign currencies.
